# Instructions

* Create a JavaScript program that takes orders for Chipotle (or another restaurant with a small menu).
* Use functions so that key portions of your code are reusable.
* Include the options in the prompt text so users know what to type.
* Push your code up to GitHub and Slack the link out (in the "In Class" channel) for others to test it
